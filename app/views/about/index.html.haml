      About me
    %p.mt-0.mb-5
      Hi there! I'm JM Arenas, a student from Avion School!
    
    %p.mt-0.mb-5
      I graduated from Colegio de Sta. Teresa de Avila with a Bachelors's Degree in Information Technology. I started working as a Software Engineer as soon as I graduated, building windows apps for different departments and divisions.

      With 3 years ofÂ experience, I still felt lacking on so many things so I started pursuing Web Development and enrolled myself at Avion School to strengthen my foundations and build my confidence on my journey to be a successful Software Engineer.

      Everyone grows at their own pace. Don't compare yourself to anyone.
